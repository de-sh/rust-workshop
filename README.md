# Rust Workshop

Hey folks, welcome to this adventure on planet git. I am Devdutt Shenoi, let me be your guide today. We are heading to the shores of a land of crustaceans, it's called rust-lan(d)g :D

Awesome, nnow that I have introduced myself and what we are going to be up to, let me answer a question that you might be itching to ask, why? Why even land on an unknown and scary looking place full of the unknown? I have a simple answer for you, because it is going to be fun!

Also, rust is filled with tons of great learnings for any programmer, be it the novice ones right out of school/going through a career change, or the veterans trying to learn something for fun!

So, again, why are we learning about rust-lang?
1. Because it is a fun and really challenging language that teaches you a lot about programming computers.
2. As a langauge it doesn't think of it's users as naive or experts, from my experience it considers you a human, with the ability to write both masterpieces and `<insert profanity>` ;)
3. It has a great community of folks that swear by it and use it to write awesome software, so lets go!

### I am ready, what next?
Head over to the `lesson-1` branch to start with the workshop.
